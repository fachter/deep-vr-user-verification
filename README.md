# Deep VR User Verification

Repository to my Masterthesis ("Motion-Based User Authentication in VR Using Deep Metric Learning with Probabilistic Embeddings")

Parts of the Code originate from my [supervisor](https://github.com/cschell) created for one of his papers "[Versatile User Identification in Extended Reality
using Pretrained Similarity-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07517)"


# Thesis Content

In my thesis, users were verifies in virtual reality (VR) using their movements with a Deep Metric Learning (DML) approach 
implemented in PyTorch with PyTorch Lightning and PyTorch Metric Learning. 
For monitoring Weights & Biases was used in combination with hydra.

The thesis was written at Julius-Maximilian-University (in WÃ¼rzburg).

I used the two datasets [Who is Alyx?](https://github.com/cschell/who-is-alyx) and [BOXRR-23](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/metaverse/boxrr-23/),
as well as a newly generated dataset in which my participants had to write words and perform attack scenarios.
All dataset were processed with the [Machine Learning Toolbox](https://github.com/cschell/Motion-Learning-Toolbox).
